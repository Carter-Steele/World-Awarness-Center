<h1> The Nuclear Option</h1>
<h3>By Carter Steele</h3> 	
<p>By now more and more people begining to realize the present and upcoming dangers of climate change there is a huge push among these people to stop most coal, oil, and natural gas consumption due to the high amount of pollutants they can realease. These people’s arguments have merit other than the fact of how deeply routed coal and oil are to the global economy and everyday life. The people who have these arguments often call for more wind and solar energy citing the reason as wind and solar power are unlimited and green, but most of them skip over one source of power that really is our best bet of beating climate change: nuclear power. Nuclear power is a process that uses a controlled nuclear explosion to heat water and turn it into electricity and power homes.  Many nations are turning to energy sources like nuclear to get their power. China has been putting quite a few reactors on the grid. While the United States hasn’t put a reactor online since 1996. Factors such as the large amount of regulations and the general public lack of knowledge about the safety of such reactors. I wonder if the people who adamantly oppose nuclear reactors care that much about the climate as they say they do, if they did they would know that nuclear energy is safe and green and that the time is now to build these things as we being to phase out old coal power plants. The people who oppose the nuclear option for power cite things accidents like three-mile Island, Chernobyl, and most recently Fukushima. And while nuclear accidents are scary there has only been one truly deadly accident Chernobyl and the reason for the disaster was the cutting of corners in the plant to appease dictators. These people claim that accidents like three-mile island cause more cancer but that is simply not true the county that three-mile island has some of the lowest rates of cancer according to the CDC, NIH, and National cancer institute.

	Most of the people who dislike nuclear power seem hell-bent on achieving untenable goals like such as no more oil and coal power, or mostly wind and solar power. While these are good goals to keep in the back of the mind if we are on our way to a net-zero carbon emission country nuclear and hydropower are our best ways to get there. So I ask why not support the nuclear option?</p>
