<h1> <span>Time</span> To <span>Act</span> Is <span>Now<span> </h1><br>

    <p id = "essay">The most renowned Climate Change activists are children. We are in a thoughtless world where children are left to wipe away the mess adults have made and continue to make right this very second. Because in one second, two and a half million pounds of Carbon Dioxide are added to the atmosphere. In one second, a football field of trees is wiped from existence. In one second, over a million species face extinction. And yet adults do not act. They comfort us,  but at what point is comforting lying? What does it take to convince adults that this event is the defining moment in our generation? When will we, as the human race, comprehend that we need to act? We need to act because each year wildfires rage in countries around the globe, because a million species of animals are threatened, because human lives are at stake? When will politics stop and action resume? Human nature may cause us to take the easy road, but there will be a highway of problems later on. Choosing to ignore the Climate Crisis will result in tornadoes, more frequent wildfires, floods, storms, and loss of human life. There will be mass extinction regarding species mentioned previously. And yet there is no action. 
    
    No action. If governments around the world decide to mend this catastrophe, right now, and not one of us acts on this decision, not one of us makes the switch to clean energy, then progress will cease and truthfully, the world will continue to warm. In fact, in eleven years, Climate Change will be irreversible. The time to act is now. 
    
    No action. Coastal cities throughout the world will suffer due to an increase in temperature, more hurricanes, floods, and other catastrophic weather events. But that is not all. When the ice sheets of Greenland fully melt, the sea level will rise by over six meters, which amounts to eighteen feet. The Greenland ice sheets will melt and major cities and other locations will be rendered uninhabitable. This will cause millions of people to lose their homes, 	property, and eventually, this will cost them their lives. 
    
    The time to act is now. If we do not act now, future generations will look back on us as greedy consumers unwilling to make a change. Is this the legacy we want to leave behind? Do we want to be written about as thoughtless, as idiotic, as a problem? No. None of us do. We are all inclined to have a positive impact on the world. So act!
    
    Climate activism has been dominated by children since the 1990s, when Severn Cullis-Suzuki, 1. a precursor to Greta Thunberg, founded ECO, the Environmental Children’s Organization. In 1992, she gave a speech. It was posted on Youtube and the video was dubbed “The Girl Who Silenced the World for Five Minutes.” There are several other child activists, including Delaney Reynolds, Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, Ghislain Irazoke, and others. National Geographic has a list that I took inspiration from. 2. The point is that these activists have been doing everything they can to spread awareness and ultimately end Climate Change.
    
    When I write this essay, I want to teach the reader, but also learn more about this crisis myself. I think that, after seeing how large of a problem this really is, I realized something. It’s that the time to act is now. Because if we don’t, not only will the temperature rise, not only will Climate Change be irreversible, but lives will be lost. Humans alone have caused the extinction of over 680 vertebrate species and more are on the way. If we continue to destroy natural habitats valuable food sources will be lost. 
    
    <strong> By 2100, New York City will regularly suffer from flooding. When the Greenland Ice Sheets completely melt, half of Florida will be below the Atlantic Ocean and New Orleans will be completely underwater.</strong> 
    
        The time to act is now. As the human race nears the climate’s point of no return, as issues are now apparent, I urge you to act now as we won’t be in a position to halt and resolve Climate Change in the future.</p> <br>
