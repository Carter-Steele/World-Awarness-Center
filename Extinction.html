    <h1>The Permian-Triassic Extinction and Modern Climate Change</h1><br>
<h3> Daniel Yang, July of 2021</h3>



<p id = " Main-essay">The term “mass extinction” for most people evokes almost instant association with the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction wasn’t even the largest mass extinction, simply the most well known. However, the Permian-Triassic extinction is strikingly similar to the current climate crisis that we are experiencing today. It becomes hard not to think about the possibilities of a mass extinction similar in nature to the Permian-Triassic extinction due to the fact that human activity is producing the same environment necessary for a mass extinction of this nature. There is wide and undeniable scientific consensus that the cause for the Permian-Triassic extinction was widespread emission of Carbon Dioxide, causing the deprivation of dissolved oxygen in the oceans as well as the general acidification of the oceans caused by wide scale volcanic eruptions and outgassing in the region that is now Siberia. The recovery from this extinction took about 10 million years. The widespread volcanic activity and outgassing in the now Siberia contributed to an increase of 2,000 parts per million in the abundance of Carbon Dioxide, as well as a global average increase of 8 degrees Celsius in temperature. As is a common theme today, the cumulative increase in temperature may seem incremental, however the effect could not be farther from that distinction. Also attributed to the Permian-Triassic extinction is the increase in the presence of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Many proponents of the current climate change denial movement, even if they do accept the fact that there is an increase in Carbon Dioxide from about 280 ppm in the Pre-industrial era to about 415 ppm in modern times, believe that this dramatic increase in the amount of Carbon Dioxide is insignificant or does not pose that large of a threat. It is clear from close examination of previous instances of mass extinction that they can and have been caused by depletion of dissolved oxygen and ocean acidification due to the increase of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. Although the increase in carbon dioxide caused by humans is minute compared to the increase of carbon dioxide caused by the volcanic outgassing in the Siberian Traps, (135 compared to nearly 2,000 increase in ppm) the current increase in carbon dioxide in ppm has already caused drought, forest fires, and a general decrease in agricultural yields. Additionally, not only has the amount of carbon dioxide in parts per million increased in the past 70 years, the rate at which it increases has accelerated at an alarming rate. Then, it is fair to ask if the damage we cause to the environment can be alleviated. There is near unanimous scientific consensus among climate scientists that the current climate change is caused by humans. In the general population, there is less of this consensus and more uncertainty, denial, and confusion as to the facts about climate change. At this point in time, it becomes increasingly and increasingly clear to us that public information on climate change becomes more and more necessary. Unfortunately, the number of people who deny climate change hasn’t reduced significantly in recent times. It is more and more clear that public cooperation in mitigating the effects of climate change is more and more necessary in order to actually mitigate climate change. It will take one of the largest economic, social, and political mobilizations in history to organize an effort to save the environment large enough to actually reverse the effects of climate change before it is too late. It would be enormously hopeful, however not unrealistic to seek this economic, social, and political mobilization. However, in order to make such a mobilization possible, it is clear that public support and understanding for the current climate crisis is achieved. Undoubtedly, this also requires an increased effort in public information as to climate change. Still, in 2021, we have people actively denying, downplaying and dismissing the climate crisis. Unless those who previously had doubts about climate change are convinced otherwise, it is unfortunate that a large-scale economic social and political mobilization will be nearly impossible. I strongly encourage and implore you to make your own efforts in informing people about the dangers of climate change. To those who are already aware of the dangers of climate change, they must be actively aware of the dangers of climate change. This crisis will test the human race and many, like me, have true hope that we can unite to address this growing crisis.</p><br>
