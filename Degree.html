<Body> <h1>I Hold No Degrees</h1>
    <h3> Daniel Yang, May of 2021 </h3><br> 
    
    <p>I am no scholar. I hold no degrees. But I have passion for the issues that are present. Passion for the issues that have so often been neglected by even the most well-meaning people. We are all internally well-meaning people, and that in spite of corrupting actions that cause us by nature of reality to do harm and vice, we all possess the mutual human ability to recognize the true issues that endanger us. The facts that are objectively presented to us on the issue of climate change do not present, import, nor suggest any form of bias. There is nothing political on the issue of base existence or non-existence. Even then, there are still those who seek to usurp or undermine the facts presented in the course of discovery on the negative ramifications of climate change in hope of pursuing some abstract political goal. Oftentimes, it is this negligence that poses a greater danger to our world that is affected by climate change than climate change itself. Climate change, however hideous, however heinous, and however hopeless it may seem, is reversible. However, the awesome and extraordinary task of reversing climate change in itself bears burdens and costs that, however undesirable, remain necessary for the negative ramifications of climate change to be reversed. This is where the edifice of those who oppose action on climate change lay their argument. Never in human history have we accomplished something extraordinary without large initiatives, that, even in spite of their potentially negative effects, that the large initiative may remain desirable. We are again presented with this dilemma that extends into all traditional schools of thought. Do we take large action, and bear the unpleasant yet transient effects? Or do we neglect to take action, and bear the consequences that will not likely be felt in our lifetimes? For many, the latter seems to be the desirable one. The fact that the significant ramifications of climate change may not be felt in our lifetime already creates an umbrella under which neglect can be shielded from scrutiny. After all, our mind often struggles to cognize those consequences which may not even be felt by us. There is almost no doubt about this fact. With that in mind, most discussion about climate change becomes an issue of morality. Do we subject ourselves to these unpleasant and adverse consequences of climate change action or go down the path of neglect and enjoy our transient moment of safety before the direst consequences of climate change are apparent? It becomes so difficult and distant to think about long-term effects of climate change because we will never experience them. But the issue is more than that. The actions that we take now may dictate entire generations of actions. Our Earth has been continuing for 4.5 billion years. It is sure that more generations of the human population will come. But here, in 2021, we are at the deciding moment for what may become hundreds of years of change and the recuperation of our climate from climate change or what may become hundreds or even thousands of years of adverse, and deeply wounding, and damaging actions. The actions that we take now must represent our commitment to change, and our commitment to our environment, because there is absolutely nothing else we have other than it. In this deciding moment, it becomes our onus and obligation under the scrutiny of generations to come to create the change that may decide our future. The Earth is ill, and all some people may talk about is money. The effects of climate change, even while the direst are decades away, have already begun. The average temperature in 2020 has exceeded around 1.2 Celcius above Pre-Industrial levels. On paper, this statistic seems insignificant. However, the effects of this 1.2 Celcius gain are anything but minute. It takes an enormous amount of excess heat energy, generated by a stunning increase in the presence of Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which, in itself, is caused by a variety of factors that would have been nearly unexistent in Pre-Industrial times. The concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as Carbon Dioxide and Methane have increased more than a hundredfold percent. These, along with many others, are stunning examples of the enormous power that humans possess over the environment. From a time of being under the whim of the environment and whatever it may do to us, to a time where the environment is under the human species and whatever we may do to it, marks a stunning change in both our human ingenuity and our destructive power. When will the destruction and adverse effects of climate change become noticeable to the common person? Climate change seems to be an abstract faraway concept that only affects island nations when it truly isnâ€™t. Over a course of decades, these faraway concepts will cease to become distant and will present a true issue for us. So, we must undertake those actions that, even if they do seem unpleasant and undesirable, will assist us in mitigating the effects of climate change. In the name of the voiceless, those to be voiceless, and those affected without a mode to have their voices heard, we must all collectively demand the action that has been neglected or dismissed.<br></p>
