      <p>From the beginning, humans have sought to better their lives through technology. Scientific progress has brought us from villages to towns to massive cities with populations numbering in the tens of millions in just a few hundred years. It took two million years for the population to reach one billion, and just two hundred to reach seven billion. Progress comes with its advantages, but those unwilling to accept this have stopped the natural processes of the earth with a waste product, Carbon Dioxide.</p><br>

      <p>"We are in a thoughtless world where children are left to wipe away the mess adults have made and continue to make right this very second. Because in one second, two and a half million pounds of Carbon Dioxide are added to the atmosphere. In one second, a football field of trees is wiped from existence. In one second, over a million species face extinction.</p><br>

      <p>Mankind. A word that represents millions of years of evolution, and thousands of years of modern progress that have shaped both our modern living world and the lives of billions of people and trillions of organisms. It is now ever so apparent that we have at our whim most of the living organisms that are present on our globe today. Why, then, do we choose to neglect the ramifications of climate change now of all times?</p><br>

      <p>I am no scholar. I hold no degrees. But I have passion for the issues that are present. Passion for the issues that have so often been neglected by even the most well-meaning people. We are all internally well-meaning people, and that in spite of corrupting actions that cause us by nature of reality to do harm and vice, we all possess the mutual human ability to recognize the true issues that endanger us.</p><br>
