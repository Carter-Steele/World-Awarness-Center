<h1> Endangered Bears and the Sixth Mass Extinction</h1> 


<h3> Sean Calhoun, August of 2021</h3> 

<id> The spirit bears. So rare that they most likely number less than two thousand. Their habitats are few and far between, only found in remote locations such as the coasts of British Columbia, Canada. Even with their acknowledged rarity, humans have destroyed all but one Kermode Bear habitat.

Over 250 miles long, the Great Bear Rainforest is now the only remaining spirit bear domain left on Earth. The Rainforest is not exclusively reserved for the spirit bear, though. It is home to black bears and even trees over a thousand years old. Even though its local flora and fauna consist of organisms found in the northern hemisphere, this biome still qualifies as a rainforest; it receives 8-16 inches of precipitation per year. Aside from plants and animals, humans have populated British Columbia for millennia, specifically Native Americans.

In Canada alone, there are over fifty First Nations, which make up approximately 630 communities. Although this number may seem large at first glance, remember that there are 19,502 villages, towns, and cities in the United States. 1. The First Nations are defined as all native American tribes except for the Métis and the Inuit in Canada, whereas in the United States the criteria involve all federally recognized indigenous peoples. In Native American theology, sprit bears, which are a special white variant of black bears, were turned white by the “creator of the Universe to remind its people the past period of time known as the ice age. It was said that the creator did this to remind the native people of the previous hardship living in all the snow and ice,” according to source number 2. It is plainly seen that Kermode Bears hold a special place in their religion, which is why it is so disturbing that they are disappearing.

The number two thousand is a more positive estimate at how many are left, with some at just one hundred. 3. But in this changed world, more species than one could ever imagine are at risk. According to a plaque in the Chicago Field Museum, there were not just five mass extinctions. In fact, we are living through one at present. As I write this, at least 150 species have gone extinct in the past day. This is according to Yale, quoting the United Nations! 4. And yet, some still doubt the existence of climate change, still questioning if it is really caused by humans or something else. In the most recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report on the global climate, it is stated that it is “unequivocal” that humans cause climate change, let alone bring up doubts that it exists! 5. 

When one sees with their own eyes a three thousand page report made by hundreds of scientists from around the globe, how does one doubt that the planet is warming? How does one disregard the work of the IPCC, the UN, and virtually every climatologist in the world?

	But I believe that people will open their eyes to this catastrophe, that they will understand the depth of this crisis. I can say with absolute certainty that we can join forces over a common goal: to stop the the sixth mass extinction.

	Humans are different from other species. Not because we have emotion or superior intelligence, but because we possess extraordinary technology. From microscopes to particle accelerators, there is no question that we are advanced. We’ve set foot on the moon! 

	But there is a percentage of our population that doesn’t choose to believe in science as we know it. Although this number is small, it is significant. Of course, most people who don’t acknowledge climate change actually do believe in science. A report by the Pew Research Center states that most Americans believe that science has changed the world for the better, but there’s still a “wide gap” between what scientists believe and what the public does. 6. On the matter of global warming, 94% of scientists agree that it is a serious crisis, whereas only 65% of Americans believe so. 

	But the population that doesn’t believe in modern science chooses other methods to explain the world. Specific religions such as the Church of the Christian Scientist don’t believe in medicine, and believe that prayer is the only way of healing those in pain. Most religions don’t teach that, luckily. Many people don’t believe that evolution exists, and some say that the Earth was made in seven days. Nothing is wrong with these beliefs until they become dangerous. For instance, it doesn’t matter whether or not the population believes in evolution, as that doesn’t pose any threat (Although one should trust scientists’ views on that subject), but the beliefs of the Christian Scientists can cause serious problems. Simply stated, not allowing people to get help from medical professionals during a pandemic can be detrimental and spreads viruses even more.

	No matter your religion, not one teaches that mass extinctions didn’t happen. Not one. Not one doubts that the dinosaurs went extinct, and none of them even remotely mentioned climate shifts. After all, most religions around today became common around a few thousand years ago. This list includes Christianity in particular, with over 2.1 billion people practicing it. 7. Beliefs aside, almost no religions state anything wrong with scientists’ views on the global climate. 

	So whatever your beliefs, I urge you to place more trust in science. I don’t want you to abandon your religion or your faith, I just want someone to act on the knowledge given to us by the scientific community.</id>p>
