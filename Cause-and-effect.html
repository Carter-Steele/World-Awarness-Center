<h1> Cause and Effect</h1>
<h3> Sean Calhoun, May of 2021</h3>

From the beginning, humans have sought to better their lives through technology. Scientific progress has brought us from
villages to towns to massive cities with populations numbering in the tens of millions in just a few hundred years. It took
two million years for the population to reach one billion, and just two hundred to grow to seven billion. Progress comes
with its advantages, but those unwilling to accept this have stopped the natural processes of the earth with a waste product,
Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide gas is one part carbon and two parts oxygen. Carbon Dioxide makes up about 0.4% of the atmosphere
as of today, or 400 ppm (parts per million). According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the amount
of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere (400 ppm) is the highest concentration of it in 800,000 years. The second-highest concentration
occurred about 300,000 years ago when the ppm reached 300. This was pretty normal for Earth because Carbon Dioxide levels
stayed at about 290 ppm for most of history. Variations were common but measurements were fairly even until the Industrial
Revolution in the 1880s. At about that time, Co² levels spiked, reaching 400 ppm in 2019. Studies show that this level will
continue to increase. This may seem normal, but it is far from that. In fact, this "daily" swaying of Co² levels has now
increased 100 ppm past the 300 ppm mark. This data was taken from NOAA, an established United States governmental agency.
1. 2. This is an interesting development. Why did the Co² levels suddenly increase by 100 ppm? Why did this happen at the
start of the Industrial Revolution? During the Industrial Revolution in the 1880s, the production of new factories was greatly
fueled by the travel industry, which was also revolutionized due to coal and oil. Coal and oil, found underground, were amazing
fuel sources. Burning these released Carbon Dioxide gas into the atmosphere. But why? Coal and Oil consist of degraded biological
material. Biological materials store different waste gases such as Carbon Dioxide and Methane. When these gases were released
into the atmosphere, it caused a massive spike in Co² levels. Continuing to use this fuel will cause this level to rise exponentially.
More people= more cars= more fuel. To be clear, Carbon Dioxide gas is stored underground in oil and coal until humans use
methods of mining and fracking to harvest them as fuel. With that answered, exactly how much Carbon Dioxide is pumped into
the air every year? According to the United States Energy Information Administration, 3. in 2019, approximately 5.1 billion
tons of Co² were expelled into the atmosphere in the United States alone. This number barely compares to the world total,
estimated at 33.1 billion metric tons. So why is 400 ppm considered an international problem by scientists? What is the effect
of Co² on the atmosphere, human life, and ultimately the future of the planet's ecosystem? Changing the contents of Earth's
atmosphere must have some effect. So how much Carbon Dioxide can we pump into the atmosphere before we see an immediate threat?
According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 4. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 5. and
several studies done by scientists and reported on CBS News, 6. the tipping point is 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius. So how much
carbon dioxide is required to raise the temperature that much? Since 1880, the average global temperature has risen by approximately
1 degree Celsius or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. From 1880-2021, the global temperature must have risen about 0.007 degrees Celsius
per year (0.014 in Fahrenheit). Therefore when Co² levels began to spike in the 1880s from 290 ppm to 400 ppm there would
be a yearly ppm average of 0.78 ppm of Carbon Dioxide emitted in the atmosphere. This means that for every 0.78 ppm of Carbon
Dioxide added to the atmosphere the Earth will warm about 0.007 degrees Celsius or 0.014 degrees Fahrenheit. How many tons
of Co² is 0.78 ppm? First, what are parts per million? When discussing Climate Change, we are talking about how there are
400 particles of Carbon Dioxide for every 1 million air particles. How many air particles are there? There are about 10 to
the 44th power, the number one followed by 44 zeros. To simplify this, a 1 with 44 zeros is called 100 Tredecillion. So how
many particles of Carbon Dioxide are there? Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to calculate this equation without a supercomputer.
Another equation that may be used is to calculate how many cubic kilometers are 400 Co² particles. By doing this, we can
relate that to how many cubic kilometers are in the atmosphere. There are approximately 4.2 billion. 400 Co² particles will
certainly not fill an entire cubic kilometer, so let's convert this equation to meters. 4.2 billion times 1 billion equals
4.2e+18, or 4.2 quintillion. 400 Carbon Dioxide particles still won't fill a cubic meter, so this problem needs to be simplified
further. 4.2 quintillion cubic meters needs to be converted into cubic feet. by multiplying this number by 35.3147, we will
acquire the number of cubic feet, 148,321,600,230,252,085,000. Now for Co². 400 ppm of Carbon Dioxide equals about 0.0249426919
cubic feet. This means that 0.02 has to be multiplied by 50. 0.02 times 50 equals 1, the same as 1³. 400 times 50 equals
20,000 particles of Carbon Dioxide per cubic foot. How much Carbon Dioxide does it take to fill up an entire cubic foot?
Once we know this, we can calculate the number, in pounds, a certain amount of Co² is. 1 foot³ of Co² generally weighs around
1 pound. This means there is a nearly incalculable number of pounds of Co² in the atmosphere, so in short, I cannot figure
this out by myself while using a digital calculator, Wikipedia, and Quora. So why does Carbon Dioxide cause the Earth's temperature
to rise? The Greenhouse effect is a term often heard when discussing Global Climate Change. But what is it? In a Greenhouse,
light is converted into heat. According to 7, "Greenhouses can get too hot, which is why many have windows, vents or fans
to help release hot air as needed." Earth is much the same way. Different gases have the ability to trap light and convert
it into heat by bouncing it back and forth through the atmosphere. These types of gases include Methane, Carbon Dioxide,
and others found as tiny traces in the sky. Throughout most of history, this detrimental effect was deflected by sea ice.
Sea ice is white, a color that reflects all colors of the light spectrum. This reflective effect sends light back into space.
Unfortunately, adding or subtracting greenhouse gases can be destructive. Having too little Carbon Dioxide would make the
Earth a cold and uninhabitable ice ball in space. Too much, and Global Warming comes into play. What are the effects we see
today? According to NASA, Climate Change can cause more frequent wildfires, droughts, and other natural disasters. In fact,
adding just 0.5 degrees Celsius of temperature could cause a global tipping point, where Global Warming is irreversible or
irreversible damage has occurred to the ecosystem and biosphere. At the rate we are adding Co² to the atmosphere, there is
actually a point where Global Climate Change will be unstoppable. As stated by 8, the United Nations official website, there
are "Only 11 Years Left to Prevent Irreversible Damage from Climate Change, Speakers Warn during General Assembly High-Level
Meeting." This article can specifically be found in 9.<br>
